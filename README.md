# mammal-pain-project
Our project is interested in developing automated affect recognition across mammalian species including horses, dogs, monkeys, rats, cows, donkeys, and humans. The project is the product of combined efforts of members from the University of California Davis, the University of California San Diego, and several universities in Scandinavia.
